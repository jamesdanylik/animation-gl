Project Notes
=============

Enclosed is my submission for Project 2 of CS174A.  My animation is roughly the beginning
of a movie, inluding a few animated title cards, and the opening scene of a famus SciFi
movie.  

My project includes numerous advanced concepts, like Shader Fade and Transparency Effect,
a skybox mode for rendinging surfaces outside of the lighting equation, keyframe-based
figure animation, and finally some basic audio support of linux.

Instructions
============

Build using the included Makefile by running 'make.'  The '__NO_AUDIO__' constant should
be dfined automatically if the platfrom does not support basic ALSA audio; if there is a
problem, or the program is desired without audio, simply uncomment the line included in
anim.cpp.
